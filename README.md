# Titanic
This project is based on an ongoing competition on kaggle with the name titanic machine learning competition. 
In this project I classified the features in a logical manner and dealt with many null values.
I used different machine learning models like logistic regression, decision tree and some boosting models.

Conclusion
At the end catboost model provided the best outcome with 82.78% accuracy.
This helped me reach in the top 2% of all the competitors.
