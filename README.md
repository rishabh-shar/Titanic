# Titanic
This project is based on an ongoing competition on kaggle with the name titanic machine learning competition. 
In this project I classified the features in a logical manner and dealt with many null values.
I used different machine learning models like logistic regression, decision tree and some boosting models.

# Motivation
This was the first data science project that I ever attempted.
The motivation behind this was too just complete a project from end to end by applying what I have learnt.
I was very excited about working on this because I had heard a lot about the titanic dataset and I wanted to achieve a good rank on this which at last I got.

# What I have learned?
As this was my first project I learned a lot from this.
Whatever theory I have learned from different sources, I tried to make use of most of it.
I also learned a lot about machine learning from this project by using many different models like regression models and boosting models.

# Conclusion

At the end catboost model provided the best outcome with 82.78% accuracy.
This helped me reach in the top 2% of all the competitors.
